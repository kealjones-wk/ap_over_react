# AP OverReact: Advanced Patterns in OverReact

AP OverReact is a Dart implementation of the Egghead Course by Kent C. Dodds: 

[Egghead Course: Advanced React Patterns](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns)

[Github Repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/advanced-react-patterns-v2/tree/egghead/)

Follow along with the videos in his course while doing these exercises to get the full benefit,
even though it is not directly 1 to 1 the concepts are the same and if you ever get stuck take a look at exercises-final to see how it is properly implemented.

## Requires Dart 2
Yep, only dart 2 sorry.

## Get Started
1. First, you'll need to run `pub get`.
2. Then run `webdev serve --auto=restart`.
3. Open Chrome to http://localhost:8080
4. Navigate to the `lib/src/exercises` directory and get started by editing `01.dart`, and because this is dart 2 all changes you make will automatically hot reload in your browser!
